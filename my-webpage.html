                Dubai is a city and emirate in the United Arab Emirates known for luxury shopping, ultramodern
                architecture and a lively nightlife scene. Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower, dominates the
                skyscraper-filled skyline. At its foot lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights choreographed to music.
                On artificial islands just offshore is Atlantis, The Palm, a resort with water and marine-animal park

                Located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf, Dubai aims to be
                the business hub of Western Asia. It is also a major global transport hub for passengers and
                cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the city, which was already a major
                mercantile hub. A centre for regional and international trade since the early 20th century, Dubai's
                economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation, real estate, and financial services.

                The Voortrekker Monument is located just south of Pretoria in South Africa. This massive granite
                structure is prominently located on a hilltop, and was raised to commemorate the Voortrekkers who left
                the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854.

                On 8 July 2011 the Voortrekker Monument, designed by the architect Gerard Moerdijk, was declared a
                National Heritage Site by the South African Heritage Resource Agency.
